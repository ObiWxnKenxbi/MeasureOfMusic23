This was a project for the Measure Of Music Hackathlon 2023. 

We utilized a combination of cutting-edge tools including Chartmetric and SeatGeek APIs to develop an innovative app that predicts an artist's potential live performance turnout based on their streaming and social media metrics such as listenership, engagement, and views. This enables us to provide valuable insights to help artists make informed decisions about their live performances and connect with their fans in meaningful ways.

Install dependencies:
